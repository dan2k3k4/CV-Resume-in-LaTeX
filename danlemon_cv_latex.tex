\vspace*{-\baselineskip}
\begin{compactitemize}
\item Involved with designing, building and implementing a working \textbf{GUI-based XML-Editor} that produced PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) code and utilizes the NFS network for storage. It was a large project and is used to help the engineers produce PLC code in a shorter period of time without needing expert knowledge of a PLC.
\item Extensive use of Agile methodology; development progression via \textbf{iterative prototyping}, continuous code refactoring including implementing some features of Scrum such as a weekly sprint of tasks to-do, tasks currently being done, and completed tasks.
\item Included development work in Java, XML and Python; as well as integrating ant build scripts and updating the code-base under, subversion, a version control system.
\item Worked with supervisor on initial project planning; different clients would request feature changes and submit bug reports via \textbf{JIRA}. Also worked alongside many French speaking employees and took two French learning courses to increase personal knowledge of the language.
\item Parallel to building the project, involved with providing aid in the running and organising of social events for students under 30 years old. Organised monthly \textbf{networking} event for new arrivals to CERN and invite everyone so that the new people would easily integrate with others.
\item CERN offers every employee the chance to expand their knowledge on any platform domain so it was easy to self educate about different technologies such as XML, XPATH, Python, and Agile development.
